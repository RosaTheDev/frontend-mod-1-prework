## Section 2 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?

  - I honestly don't like asking questions when I don't feel comfortable. I realized that I need to be more engaged
      and ask questions more often and not be timid if I am going to be successful

1. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node, and really sent you off to learn about functions by exploring several outside resources. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?

  - I liked the easing into letting us figure it out on our own, I think that is a great skill to have
    to look things up on your own with little guidance. I read the JavaScript book on functions a
    few times. I tried to really understand what I was reading and even looked up a few videos.

1. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.

      - a conditional statement is a if else statement, we can find conditional
        statements in everyday life such as using google chrome. if you press the
        x button on the tab the tab will close, otherwise it stays open.

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.

    - you can add multiple conditions to an if statement by adding else if, what
    this does is checks to see if the first if statement is true, if it is then it skips
    if not it checks to see if that statement is true and completes the tasks that
    is within that individual code block.

1. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?

  - I think you can use a || or & which are comparison operators, what they do is
    || checks to see if ONE returns true it basically stands for (or), one can be true and one can be false and it still returns true
    & checks to see if BOTH returns true, both need to be true for this to run

1. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?
