## Section 4 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?
  - It felt worse, I still don't have a good grasp on classes and I need to study those a bit more. I have been getting in the habit of working for two hours and taking small breaks such as walking the dog or eating, I also managed to put my whiteboard away from my computer so that I need to get up to mark off tasks.

1. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?
  - I was totally distracted and I got way behind in finishing this section of the prework. I managed to work through it though. I realize my faults and what I need to focus on, I'm cutting distractions from my life so I can become more focused

1. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?
  - an array is a collection of datatypes, an array could be a list of strings, or integers or even a list of booleans! Meanwhile an Object is like a blueprint of something, it can hold strings, arrays, booleans. Like how a house has certain descriptions in a blueprint so does an object. I like to think of it as a type of guideline.

1. For each set of data, would an array or object be better to store it? Explain your choice.

  * List of all of the students in class
    - array
  * List of states and their capitals
    - object
  * List of things to pack for vacation
    - object
  * Names of all the Instagram accounts I follow
    - array
  * List of student names and their cohort
    - object
  * Ingredients and amount of each ingredient to bake a cake
    - object
  * All my favorite restaurants
    - array

1. In this section, we talked about an `transaction item object`. It has keys that represent different properties an bank transaction would have, and values that store the data. In a banking app, this data would eventually be displayed in the browser for the user. Think of another Object in a web application that you use frequently. What is it? What keys might be on it? What are example values?

1. What questions do you still have about classes and/or Objects?
  - The biggest problem I had with classes was with classProperties, I didn't exactly know how to create a class just like how they asked. I know how to make a class and how to give it properties but I just didn't understand that part yet.
  - Another problem I ran into is incrementing a count in an object, like seeing how many followers there are but also how to keep counting the follower count.
