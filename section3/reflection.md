## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

1. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.

  - I think that in Instagram and Facebook they both use arrays to store  user's posts.

1. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.

  - an array method is just a function that works on arrays

1. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?
  - the way I would describe a loop is a way to automate a task a certain amount of times. You can use loops in an array for example to print out the same message but changing only the names in the array, such as "Hello [Johnny]" "Hello [Bethany]"
    - meanwhile you can use a loop to print out the same sentence a certain amount of times

1. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?

  - a loop would be when you turn a light on and off really fast a lot of times
  
1. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?
