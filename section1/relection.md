## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.
    Numbers, Strings, and Booleans.
    - Numbers can be whole numbers 1,2,3,4 called integers
    - Strings are just sentences as if you're talking to the computer they use " " quotations
    - Booleans are comparisons and are comparing to see if something is equal,
      not equal, less than, greater than or equal to something else. they return a true or false.
    - Variables are giving a name to something could be a number, string or even a boolean
    - concatenation are when you join a string and a variable or number or a even a boolean.  

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?
  - console.log('Hello World!');

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?
  - you can use // or /* */ for multi line comments

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?
  - a variable is just a fancy word for giving something a name, technically the word
    computer is a variable for a certain machine

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?
  - for sure I've seen strings and Numbers like when a website is letting you know many
  days you have left of a free trial they usually use your name which would be a string
  and they let you know how many days you have left by giving you a number.
  altogether they would more than likely use concatenating in order to achieve this.


7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.
    - concatenation are when you join a string and a variable or number or a even a boolean.

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatention?
    - Adobe whenever I have a free trial how they always left me know how many days I have left and begging for me to buy the product.

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)
    - no questions although I realized for me to even run the javascript files on my terminal I had to use node <JavaScriptfile>.js
